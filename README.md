Hi! ðŸ‘‹
=
I'm Reece Smith
-
I'm a student at Edinburgh Napier University Merchiston campus studying Software Engineering.
My main interests are anything to do with technology and computers, and music - particularly contemporary classical.
I prefer coding in Python, but I quite like using Java. I also use a lot of the big 3 web languages (HTML, CSS, JS) and PHP.

I'm looking to develop my skills as a programmer by creating repositories on GitHub to share my work with others! :)
